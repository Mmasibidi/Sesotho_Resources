# Sesotho_Resources
The corpus creation: Wikipedia Sesotho. Wikipedia is used because data does not have copyright and is accessible.
To add to the Wikipedia corpora, Sesotho books that are out of copyright will be digitised. These books are found at the NWU library and Sesotho Musuem. Communicate with the librarian from NWU and curator from Sesotho Museum. There are talks between SADiLaR and Sesotho Museum to digitise their books that are out of copyright.
## Idea:
  1) Take book that is out of print and digitise
  2) create open corpora
  3) use corpora to extract frequency list
  4) develope guideline on how other stakeholders can contribute to the corpora
## Results: 
            Open corpora
            Frequency list
            ADHO: Poster/shortpaper abstract and presentation
